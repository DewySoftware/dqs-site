# Buy DQS

**This page contains information on purchasing DQS and getting started with instance setup.**

<div class="callout callout--danger">
  <p><strong>Discord & Patreon</strong></p>
  <p>In order to get started with DQS, you must join the <a href="https://discord.gg/8mWZqv5">Discord</a> and create a Patreon account or Paypal account. Leaving the Discord is also very strongly discouraged, as you will lose access to some features.
  </p>
</div>

## Free Trials

Free trials can be arranged on Discord by DMing Dewy. For free trials, only 1 account can be used (ie the focus module would be disabled) but all other features would be present.

## Billing & Payment

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p><strong>Currency</strong></p>
  <p>Please note that DQS is paid for in GBP, though other currencies can be used through Patreon's automatic conversion system.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p><strong>Other Payment Methods</strong></p>
  <p>If Patreon isn't an optimal payment method for you, one time payments for however many months can be purchased through <a href="https://paypal.me/dewysoftware">PayPal</a>, cryptocurrencies or by other means. See <a href="#alternative-payment-methods">here</a> for details.
  </p>
</div>

Once you've joined the Discord server and have made a Patreon account, head **[here](https://patreon.com/dewysoftware)** to subscribe to DQS.

Due to how Patreon payments work, the subscription model works like this;

- Payments are collected on the 1st of every month.
- You pay your first £5 on the day you sign up.

Because of this, it may be wiser to begin your subscription earlier on in the month, to get more bang for your buck.

If you wish to add multiple accounts to your DQS purchase (each extra account costs £5 extra per month), you must create a custom pledge for the due amount.

So, for example, 4 accounts total will cost £20/mo, and 3 accounts total will cost £15/mo, etc.

## Alternative Payment Methods

- **[PayPal](https://paypal.me/dewysoftware)**
- **Bitcoin:** COMING SOON
- **Stellar:** `GCCEUIDWCS6T5HIJTOWYSV5U33ZJLD2UYH4UAS4FRJL5Q6GLOKJHJNOK`

**Payment is also accepted in the form of server boosts and Nitro gifts, DM me to arrange those.**

## Getting Started

Once you've subscribed to DQS and Dewy has set up your instance, here is how to get your instance up and running.

1. **Sign In** - Use the `&signin` command to authenticate and connect. If you have privacy concerns, see the documentation.
2. **Enter The Gateway** - Connect using your normal Minecraft client to `dqs.dewy.dev`. Get your authentication code with `/auth` and use it to authenticate to take control of your instance.
3. **Configure** - Change module settings to just the way you want them and even switch servers.
4. **Use** - From here, DQS is all yours. Go nuts with all of its brilliant features!

## Next Steps

To maximise the potential of DQS, you should view the documentation to leverage all of its features, including Taribone.
