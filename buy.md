# Buy DQS

**This page contains information on purchasing DQS and getting started with instance setup.**

<div class="callout callout--danger">
  <p><strong>Discord & Patreon</strong></p>
  <p>In order to get started with DQS, you must join the <a href="https://discord.gg/8mWZqv5">Discord</a> and create a Patreon account. Leaving the Discord is also very strongly discouraged, as you will lose access to some features.
  </p>
</div>

## Billing & Payment

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <p><strong>Currency</strong></p>
  <p>Please note that DQS is paid for in GBP, though other currencies can be used through Patreon's automatic conversion system.
  </p>
</div>

Once you've joined the Discord server and have made a Patreon account, head **[here](https://patreon.com/dewysoftware)** to subscribe to DQS.

Due to how Patreon payments work, the subscription model works like this;

- Payments are collected on the 1st of every month.
- You pay your first £5 on the day you sign up.

Because of this, it may be wiser to begin your subscription earlier on in the month, to get more bang for your buck.

If you wish to add multiple accounts to your DQS purchase (each extra account costs £5 extra per month), you must create a custom pledge for the due amount.

So, for example, 4 accounts total will cost £20/mo, and 3 accounts total will cost £15/mo, etc.

## Getting Started

Once you've subscribed to DQS on the Patreon, you must DM Dewy on Discord to get started with setting up your instance. Response times are guaranteed within 24 hours.

As soon as you've provided the necessary information, your instance will be initialised, and you will be granted access.

## Next Steps

To maximise the potential of DQS, you should view the documentation to leverage all of its features, including Taribone.
