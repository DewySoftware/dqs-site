# About DQS

DQS (Dewy's QueueSkip) is an account management and proxy service, designed for use in anarchy Minecraft environments.
It's primarily intended for use on 2B2T, hence the 'QueueSkip' bit of the name, but it can be used on any anarchy server that supports version 1.12.2

DQS keeps your account online at all times, hosted on a remote server. You *take control* of your account by connecting to `dqs.dewy.dev`. When you disconnect, your account will remain logged in.

DQS is more than a proxy, however. It comes with various utilities and boundary-pushing features, all controlled through the DQS Discord bot. The most notable include:

- **Taribone:** A form of Baritone integration.
- **Chat Utilities:** Configurable spammer, chat and whisper relay.
- **Notifications:** Warnings, queue notifications and more.

### Wait, Baritone?

Yes, that's right. Using Taribone, the DQS headless Baritone implementation, DQS can run Baritone tasks in the cloud. Using commands like `&goto` and `&path`, you can leave your account on the highway while you sleep.

This is a new feature that has never been implemented in a public facing proxy/queueing service like this before, and a great leap forward in automation.

See the [full documentation](https://dqs.dewy.dev/features) to learn about all of Taribone's features and opportunities.
