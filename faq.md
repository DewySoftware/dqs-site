# DQS FAQ

Welcome to the FAQ for DQS! Here, you'll find a bunch of quick answers to common questions. If you have a question **not** found here, feel free to get in contact via the [support](https://dqs.dewy.dev/support) system.

## Pricing & Payment

#### Why is Patreon used as the payment method?

Patreon was chosen as the official payment channel for DQS for these reasons:

- It's better than PayPal for reccuring payments / subscriptions.
- No personal details are stored by Patreon, unlike Paypal and other services.
- It's easier to track chargebackers.

For these reasons, I highly recommend anarchy services take a close look at Patreon as their payment portal.

Payment via BTC will soon become an option as well.*

#### How much does DQS cost?

Â£5/mo. The currency for purchasing DQS is GBP, though other currencies can be used, via Patreon's conversion system.
Discounts can be acquired through one of the DQS [initiatives](https://dqs.dewy.dev/initiatives), or by negotiating a custom quote for a large group.

#### How can I arrange a custom quote for my group?

Custom quotes and subscription models for larger anarchy groups can be arranged. Create a [support](https://dqs.dewy.dev/support) ticket to start a conversation.

#### Why are payments collected on the 1st of the month?

That's simply how Patreon handles payments. It isn't in my control. Sorry ._.

## Miscellaneous

#### Why is it DQS 3? I've never heard of DQS before.

DQS has been around for 2 years now, but it never gained much traction.

#### What language is DQS written in?

DQS is written entirely in Java, using the libraries listed [here](https://dqs.dewy.dev/credits).

#### Can I self-host DQS? Where are the binaries?

DQS binaries are not public, and so you can't self host. The binaries themselves are not for sale.

#### Where is the DQS source code?

DQS is a closed source product, and thus its source code is not public.
